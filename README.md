# COVID Sentiment Analysis
A sentiment analysis of Twitter data related to COVID-19 and the vaccines, originally written for my TDI coding challenge.

 The global COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged our planet for almost two years, and the COVID-19 vaccines continue to be our best bet at ending it. These vaccines may be the 
 greatest scientific achievement of our time, but anti-vaccine movements seem to be halting vaccination campaigns around the world. Understanding how these vaccines and 
 other COVID-related topics are discussed by the general public is thus an important part of the effort to end the pandemic. By understanding how the public talks about 
 COVID, government agencies and pro-vaccine groups can change their messaging to assuage fears, combat misinformation, and better reach people who remain vaccine 
 hesitant and/or against public health measures that will slow the spread of COVID.
 
 When COVID related news breaks, people take to social media to voice their opinions. Social media apps such as Twitter thus represent a promising avenue to collect 
 public sentiment and analyze what language is being used around COVID and related topics. By collecting and analyzing tweets as news breaks, we can get a snapshot of 
 public sentiment during important events.
 
 **The COVID Sentiment app scrapes Twitter for recent tweets about COVID-19 and related topics, and then analyzes whether those tweets have a positive, negative, or 
 neutral sentiment. Some helpful data visualizations are then presented. You can choose from a variety of topics, and then choose how many tweets you'd like to 
 analyze.**
 
 When you launch the app, you will be presented with this landing page:

Select a topic and number of tweets to analyze, and then click the "Get Latest Tweets" button to get something like this:

**The Project Proposal iPython notebook contains an analysis of data obtained from Kaggle, and served as the original project proposal and proof-of-concept for data analysis and presentation.**
